	abstract = {Summary: The Biopython project is a mature open source international collaboration of volunteer developers, providing Python libraries for a wide range of bioinformatics problems. Biopython includes modules for reading and writing different sequence file formats and multiple sequence alignments, dealing with {3D} macromolecular structures, interacting with common tools such as {BLAST,} {ClustalW,} and {EMBOSS,} accessing key online databases, as well as providing numerical methods for statistical learning. Availability: Biopython is freely available, with documentation and source code, at http://www.biopython.org under the Biopython license. Contact: All queries should be directed to the Biopython mailing lists, see {http://www.biopython.org/wiki/Mailing\_lists.}},
